Their is one plugin to use make it possible: [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/xclip.html][xclip]]

This plugin uses xclip/xsel on Linux, if both of them are not exist, it uses emacs `make-frame-on-display`.
They require `DISPLAY` to be set correctly. In my case, I use putty to login the server then use `emacsclient -nw`
to connect to the emacs daemon, I have no xclip/xsel installed. 
Some times the `DISPLAY` was not set correctly when multiple ssh clients connect to the server.

Follow steps can make the copy/paste works again.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq xclip--hidden-frame nil)
(setenv "DISPLAY" "localhost:12.0")
#+END_SRC
