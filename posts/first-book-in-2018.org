Heard about <The Pragmatic Programmer> long time ago, recently I use the spare time to go through this book.
It's a fantastic book, everyone start progrmming should take a look at it. I should read it 10 years ago :(.
If don't have time, just go through the Tips, jump to the tip which feel interest.

Recall the passed 10 years' career, I met so many progrmmers that forgot to care about their craft.
"Care About" is the most important, then "Think", those are the first two tips in the book.

"Don't Live with Broken Windows", it's really hard to follow in realistic, even you want to repair the window,
there will be many "guru" popup with differnt words: "Don't touch anything if it works", "Don't touch my code", etc.
Some famous words are not working in every scenario. "Critically analyze what you read and hear", That's important.

Tips in Chapter 2, I can't agree more, those are all important in daily works. DRY(Don't repeat yourself), it means
less duplication, decouple the code, make code reusable, then testable, this rule is really importatant while programming.

Each programmer should have one toolbox, there are editor, programming language, script language, debuging tool, always keep
in mind, automatic everything can be automatic. Working with readable text file instand of writing code. Generate the code
if needed.

Don't expect perfect software, what we can do is make it better. It's real life. Design by contract is a good habit when programming,
but I didn't meet any project use this way, unit test sounds like a programming way to apply design by contract. Assert is
a good way to make application crash early.

There are many ways to do decoupling, one method it mentions in the book "Blackboard" sounds interest to me.
The blackboard system can decouple each other compoletely, provide a place to share knowledge with each other.

While coding, always keep the code easy to be tested.

Organization sounds like out of the scope of programmer, but team atmosphere is really important for daily work.
