There are a lot of posts mentioned m4u solution to manage mail
under mu4e, do everything in emacs becomes my hobby when
I jump into the emacs hole.

I found one nice post to start with
[[http://cachestocaches.com/2017/3/complete-guide-email-emacs-using-mu-and-/][A COMPLETE GUIDE TO EMAIL IN EMACS USING MU AND MU4E]]

only extra information I can provide is the configuration
for office365, below is part of offlineimap configuration,
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[Repository Remote]
auth_mechanisms = GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, LOGIN
type = IMAP
maxconnections = 2
remotehost = outlook.office365.com
remoteuser = <mail address>
remotepass = <mail password>
folderfilter = lambda folder: folder in [ 'INBOX', 'Sent Items' ]
# The file is copy from Arch linux, different linux distribution has different location
sslcacertfile = ~/tls-ca-bundle.pem
#+END_SRC
