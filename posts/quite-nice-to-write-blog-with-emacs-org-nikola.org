Plan to use [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]] as my blogging tool when I read cestlaz's blog [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-17-emacs-jekyll-nikola/][Blogging with Emacs, Jekyll and Nikola]]. Today I fallow streakycobra's nice blog [[https://streakycobra.github.io/posts/blogging-in-org-mode-with-nikola/][Blogging in org-mode with Nikola]] setup my blog on github.
It's quit simple and looks nice, the big thing is I can use org-mode to write blog without extra steps.
